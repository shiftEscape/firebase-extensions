# Chatbot with ChatGPT

**Author**: Alvin James Bellero (**[https://github.com/shiftEscape](https://github.com/shiftEscape)**)

**Description**: Deploys basic, customizable chatbots using ChatGPT API and Cloud Firestore.

**Details**:
This extension facilitates a basic deployment of a chatbot powered by OpenAI's [Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api) via this [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chatgpt), with prompts and responses maintained and managed via [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).

Upon installation, you'll be prompted a list configuration parameters to customize your Chatbot implementation.

Your `prompt` might look like this:

```javascript
{
  prompt: “Please explain the Big Bag Theory to a five year-old”,
  parentMessageId: "(Optional) Message ID coming from API to track conversations"
}
```

**Additional Setup:**

Before installing this extension, make sure you have your own `OpenAI API Key` (you can get it from [here](https://platform.openai.com/)), and set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:

- **Cloud Firestore** to store prompts and AI responses.
  Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.

## Billing

This extension uses other Firebase or Google Cloud Platform services which may have associated charges:

- Cloud Functions
- Cloud Firestore

This extension also uses the following third-party services:

- OpenAI ChatGPT ([pricing information](https://openai.com/pricing))

When you use Firebase Extensions, you're only charged for the underlying resources that you use. A paid-tier billing plan is only required if the extension uses a service that requires a paid-tier plan, for example calling to a Google Cloud Platform API or making outbound network requests to non-Google services. All Firebase services offer a free tier of usage. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)

## Configuration Parameters

- **Collection Path**: Path to a Cloud Firestore collection which will represent a discussion with OpenAI's ChatGPT.

- **Prompt Field**: The field in the message document that contains the prompt. (Default: `prompt`)

- **Response Field**: The field in the message document into which to put the response. (Default: `response`)

- **Cloud Functions Location**: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).

- **Language Model**: Which language `model` do you want to use? Refer to [OpenAI's Model Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview).

- **Temperature**: What sampling `temperature` to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. [Learn more here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-temperature).

- **Nucleus Sampling Probability**: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called `nucleus sampling`, where the model considers the results of the tokens with `top_p` probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. [Learn more here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-top_p).

## Cloud Functions

- **`generateAIResponse()`**: Listens to Firestore data writes to generate conversations.

## Access Required

This extension will operate with the following project `IAM` roles:

- `datastore.user` (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process generated messages.)
